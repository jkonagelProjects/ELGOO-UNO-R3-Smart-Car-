R3 Smart Car Requirements
Operating System	Windows / macOS / Linux	Windows 10+, macOS 12+, Ubuntu 20.04+	Ensure USB drivers for the Arduino board are correctly installed (e.g., CH340 driver).
Processor	Intel/AMD Processor	64-bit, 2 GHz+	Low-power systems (e.g., Raspberry Pi Zero) may struggle to process real-time data.
RAM	Minimum 4 GB	8 GB recommended	May need more RAM for advanced programming or simulation environments.
Storage	Minimum 1 GB free	5 GB recommended	Large libraries (e.g., OpenCV for camera modules) may require additional space.
Software	Arduino IDE	1.8.19+ or Arduino IDE 2.0.0+	Verify that the Elegoo library files are added to the Arduino IDE correctly.
Python	3.10+	Needed for custom scripts or integrations. Ensure all necessary packages (e.g., pyserial) are installed.
CH340 USB Driver	Latest version	Required to connect the ELEGOO board via USB on Windows systems.
Bluetooth Terminal App	E.g., “Serial Bluetooth Terminal” on Android	Ensure the app supports HC-08 Bluetooth communication.
Elegoo Smart Car Libraries	Version provided in the kit's resources	Add these to the Arduino IDE. Incorrect installation leads to compilation errors.
Motor Driver (L298N) Control Libraries	Version provided in the kit resources	Ensure library compatibility with the Arduino IDE.
Hardware	ELEGOO Smart Robot Car Kit V4	Latest version	Ensure the kit is complete (check for screws, jumpers, etc.). Missing components may lead to assembly issues.
Arduino UNO R3 or Compatible Board	Included in the kit	Test the board before assembly; some boards may have pre-existing defects.
Motors and Wheels	Included in the kit	Ensure motors are aligned correctly to avoid poor performance or drift.
Ultrasonic Sensor	HC-SR04 or similar	Properly connect the VCC, GND, TRIG, and ECHO pins. Reversed connections can damage the sensor.
Line Tracking Sensors	Infrared line sensors included in the kit	Test sensors on a flat surface. Incorrect calibration may result in poor line detection.
Bluetooth Module	HC-08	Ensure correct wiring and pairing with the control device.
Batteries	4x AA or Rechargeable Li-ion Batteries	Weak or incompatible batteries lead to unstable power and poor performance.
Motor Driver Module	L298N	Ensure heat sink is attached if required. Overheating can cause motor driver failure.
Hidden Details	Voltage Supply	6-12V	Using higher than recommended voltage can damage components.
Wiring Connections	Secure and correct	Loose wires cause intermittent failures; double-check before powering up.
Battery Polarity	Correct alignment	Reversed polarity can permanently damage the electronics.
Serial Port Settings	Correct port and baud rate	Use 9600 baud by default. Incorrect settings will prevent communication.
Sensor Placement	Calibrated and aligned	Misaligned sensors cause inaccurate readings (e.g., line tracking or obstacle detection issues).
Debugging Tools	Multimeter, Logic Analyzer	Useful for troubleshooting wiring or component failures.
